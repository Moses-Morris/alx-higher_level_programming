Python - Classes and Objects.


Background Context : .
- OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It’s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow (and skip what we recommend you to skip, you will see them later in the curriculum).

- As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video), test again etc. The biggest and most important takeaway of this project is: experiment by yourself OOP, play with it!


Learning Objectives:.
1. Why Python programming is awesome.
2. What is OOP.
3. “first-class everything”.
4. What is a class.

8. What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes.
9. What is self.
10. What is a method.
11. What is the special __init__ method and how to use it.
12. What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
13. What is a property.
14. What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python.
15. What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python.
16. How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class.
17. How to bind attributes to object and classes.
18. What is the __dict__ of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain.
19. How does Python find the attributes of an object or class.
20. How to use the getattr function.




Tasks
0. My first square
mandatory
Write an empty class Square that defines a square:

You are not allowed to import any module.
#



1. Square with size
mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
You are not allowed to import any module
Why?

Why size is private attribute?

The size of a square is crucial for a square, many things depend of it (area computation, etc.), so you, as class builder, must control the type and value of this attribute. One way to have the control is to keep it privately. You will see in next tasks how to get, update and validate the size value.



2. Size validation
mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
You are not allowed to import any module
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ cat 2-main.py.



3. Area of a square
mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
You are not allowed to import any module.#



4. Access and update private attribute
mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
You are not allowed to import any module
Why?

Why a getter and setter?

Reminder: size is a private attribute. We did that to make sure we control the type and value. Getter and setter methods are not 100% Python, but more OOP. With them, you will be able to validate the assignment of a private attribute and also define how getting the attribute value will be available from outside - by copy? by assignment? etc. Also, adding type/value validation in the setter will centralize the logic, since you will do it in only one place.




5. Printing a square
mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
You are not allowed to import any module.



6. Coordinates of a square
mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Private instance attribute: position:
property def position(self): to retrieve it
property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers
Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
position should be use by using space - Don’t fill lines by spaces when position[1] > 0
You are not allowed to import any module.



7. Singly linked list
#advanced
Write a class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list by:

Private instance attribute: data:
property def data(self): to retrieve it
property setter def data(self, value): to set it:
data must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message data must be an integer
Private instance attribute: next_node:
property def next_node(self): to retrieve it
property setter def next_node(self, value): to set it:
next_node can be None or must be a Node, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message next_node must be a Node object
Instantiation with data and next_node: def __init__(self, data, next_node=None):
And, write a class SinglyLinkedList that defines a singly linked list by:

Private instance attribute: head (no setter or getter)
Simple instantiation: def __init__(self):
Should be printable:
print the entire list in stdout
one node number by line
Public instance method: def sorted_insert(self, value): that inserts a new Node into the correct sorted position in the list (increasing order)
You are not allowed to import any module.



8. Print Square instance
#advanced
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 6-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Private instance attribute: position:
property def position(self): to retrieve it
property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integer
Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
position should be use by using space
Printing a Square instance should have the same behavior as my_print()
You are not allowed to import any module.



9. Compare 2 squares
#advanced
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be a number (float or integer), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be a number
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
